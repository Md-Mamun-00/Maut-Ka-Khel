Maut Ka Khel 🎬
A 90's Action Thriller Gravity-Shift Game
Maut Ka Khel is a retro-style arcade runner built to capture the gritty, high-stakes energy of 90s action cinema. Instead of jumping, players must defy physics by shifting gravity to navigate an industrial warehouse filled with lethal hazards.
🕹️ How to Play
The objective is simple: Survive as long as possible.
 * Start the Game: Click the "PLAY GAME" button on the home screen.
 * Shift Gravity: - Desktop: Press the Space key or click the Left Mouse Button.
   * Mobile/Tablet: Tap anywhere on the screen.
 * The Goal: Your character will flip between the floor and the ceiling. Use this to dodge the industrial fire pits appearing on both paths.
 * Scoring: Your score increases for every obstacle you successfully pass.
 * Game Over: If you touch a fire pit, the game ends, and the signature sound plays. Click "RETRY" to jump back into the action.
🛠️ Technical Breakdown
This project was built using a "no-dependency" philosophy to ensure maximum compatibility and performance across all browsers.
 * HTML5 Canvas API: Used for high-performance 2D rendering. The game loop handles player movement, obstacle generation, and dynamic rotation.
 * Vanilla JavaScript: All game logic, physics (gravity interpolation), and collision detection are written in pure JS.
 * Web Audio API: Used for the synthesized gravity-flip sound.
 * Pure CSS3: Responsive UI designed with custom CSS (no external libraries like Tailwind) to ensure the 90s aesthetic loads instantly.
 * Asset Loading: Specifically configured to use 20251226_201057.png for character graphics and mkb-aag-made-with-Voicemod.ogg for audio feedback.
